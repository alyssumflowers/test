<h1>Bees</h1>
<p>According to all known laws of aviation, a bee should not be able to fly. Bees do not care about the laws of physics and fly anyway.</p>
<p>
  There are many <a href="bees.html">different kinds of bees</a>. Here are some examples:
  <ul>
    <li>Honeybees - they make honey</li>
    <li>Bumblebees - they bumble around</li>
    <li>Carpenter Bees - they make cool stuff out of wood or something like that</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Do not confuse bees for <a href="bad.html">wasps and hornets</a>. Bees are chaotic good to true neutral, wasps and hornets are always chaotic evil. DO NOT MESS WITH WASPS AND HORNETS</p>
