<h1>Bee Fun Facts</h1>
<p>
  Did you know that not all bees die after stinging humans once? That only applies to honeybees who have a delicate stinger.<br/>
  If you allow a honeybee to take their time to dislodge their stinger from your skin, they'll be fine and live a long, happy bee life.<br/>
  Please be nice to honeybees. We need them as they are our best pollinators.
